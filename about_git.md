# Usage of Git,Docker,Automated Testing and Continuous Integration

## Git:
* Git can be used to improve the productivity and competitiveness of a company through streamlining the coding process. Git becomes a central hub for easy code collaboration that is ideal for work projects. The branching and merging features are one of the biggest collaborative assets in Git, as branching allows independent development and merging makes it simple to combine individual work to the main project. Additionally, Git is open source so it greatly benefits businesses at no cost to them.

## Docker:
* Docker is important to business processes since it allows for easier creation, deployment, and running applications through the use of containers. Containers are significantly better than virtual machines, as they are isolated but share the OS and file libraries instead of emulating virtual hardware: which means significantly less system requirements. In addition to that, it minimizes compatibility issues because Docker runs identically on any machine (this is because all of the specifications of how the cointainer is run is located in the container itself).
